                <p class="profile">Fazal is a former teacher of mathematics with experience of undergraduate study in both computer science and aeronautical engineering. He has a longstanding passion for software development which found its inception when he studied A-Level computing. His experience in computer science and engineering has made him an effective problem-solver, and given him strong technical skills. Moreover, having worked as a teacher makes him an effective communicator and helps him to explain complex concepts to individuals from a non-technical background. His teaching experience also helps him to keep calm under pressure and manage conflicts effectively. Fazal enjoys learning new programming languages and technologies and has completed several independent programming projects in his spare time using C# and .NET Core.
